# Dodelidoo Labs - Machine Learning and AI Repository

![Dodelidoo Logo](https://github.com/Dodelidoo-Labs/.github/blob/main/assets/logo.jpg)

Welcome to the Dodelidoo Labs GitHub Repository! This repository is the go-to location for all the code (primarily Python) that I utilize for Machine Learning, Generative AI, data set management, and related tools. My work involves generating AI-created images, developing new tools, and exploring the fascinating realm of Generative Artificial Intelligence​​.

## About Dodelidoo

Dodelidoo is my brainchild, a passionate PHP programmer who enjoys all things code. My journey into AI began with experimenting with MidJourney, which eventually led me to delve into SD and training models. This journey took me down the rabbit hole of Python programming, where I explored algorithms, optimizations, and more. The [Website](https://dodelidoo.com) was built for fun, largely utilizing GPT by OpenAI. I found it to be a valuable tool when guided and directed, as it can significantly save time, but remember - GPT itself is not a programmer :D​.

## Using the Resources

The images and prompts on the website, alongside the code repository, are free for everyone to use. Please remember to attribute appropriately whatever you do with them. Note that some of the references and tools section of the website, are not created or maintained by me (read more about that on the [website about page](https://dodelidoo.com/about). They are included either because they are already publicly available or with specific permission from the owners to publish​.

To access the precise prompts used to generate the images, hover your mouse over the image or click on it. We intentionally did not include an easy "copy" feature because if you use the prompt, it would be beneficial to take the time to read and type it. This might also help you spot and correct any errors​1​.

All code on this repository is license free, unless specified else.

## Contributing

I am always open to contributions! If you'd like to contribute by sharing images, tools, references, or by contributing to the code (primarily Python), I welcome your efforts.
